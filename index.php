        <p>The cytoskeletal organization within a cell is correlated to the mechanical force of its microenvironment,
            from which it receives signals and subsequently rearranges its structure.
            The nucleus relies on cytoskeletal mechanical input through the nuclear envelope adaptor proteins to
            regulate intra-nuclear chromatin organization which determines cell function and fate in mesenchymal stem
            cells (MSCs). Forces are fundamental in cellular development and have broad importance in the field of biomedical
            engineering, yet there is presently no established means for determining the internal forces on the cell nucleus.
